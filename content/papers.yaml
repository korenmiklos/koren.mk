        Title: Economies of Scale and the Size of Exporters
        Abstract: >
            Exporters are few---less than one fifth among U.S. manufacturing firms---and are larger than non-exporting firms---about 4-5 times more total sales per firm. These facts are often cited as support for models with economies of scale and firm heterogeneity as in Melitz (2003). We find that the basic Melitz model cannot simultaneously match the size and share of exporters given the observed distribution of total sales. Instead exporters are expected to be between 90 and 100 times larger than non-exporters. It is easy to reconcile the model with the data. However, a lot of variation independent of firm size is needed to do so. This suggests that economies of scale play only a minor role in determining the export status of a firm. We show that the augmented model also has markedly different implications in the event of a trade liberalization. Most of the adjustment is through the intensive margin; and productivity gains due to reallocation are halved.

        Title: Per-Shipment Costs and the Lumpiness of International Trade
        Abstract: >
            Using detailed U.S. and Spanish export data, we document that trade costs of a per-shipment nature are associated with less frequent and larger shipments, i.e. more lumpiness, in international trade. This finding is pervasive across broad product categories, but most apparent for food products, industrial supplies and parts and accessories.

        Title: A Balls-and-Bins Model of Trade
        Abstract: >
            Many of the facts about the extensive margin of trade---which firms export, and how many products sent to how many destinations---are consistent with a surprisingly large class of trade models because of the sparse nature of trade data. We propose a statistical model to account for sparsity, formalizing the assignment of trade shipments to country, product and firm categories as balls falling into bins. The balls-and-bins model quantitatively reproduces the pattern of zero product- and firm-level trade flows across export destinations, and the frequency of multi-product, multi-destination exporters. In contrast, balls-and-bins overpredicts the fraction of exporting firms.

        Title: Technological Diversification
        Abstract: >
            Economies at early stages of development are frequently shaken by large changes in growth rates, whereas growth in advanced economies tends to be relatively stable. To explain this pattern, we propose a theory of technological diversification. Production makes use of input-varieties that are subject to imperfectly correlated shocks. Endogenous variety adoption by firms raises average productivity and provides diversification benefits against variety-specific shocks. The volatility decline thus arises as a by-product of the development process. We quantitatively assess the model’s predictions and find that for reasonable parametrizations, it can generate a decline in volatility with development consistent with empirical patterns.

        Title: "Pricing to Firm: An Analysis of Firm- and Product-Level Import Prices"
        Abstract: >
            We use Hungarian Customs data on product-level imports and exports of manufacturing firms to document that the import price of a particular product varies substantially across buying firms. Importantly, we can relate the level of import prices to firm characteristics such as size, foreign ownership and market power. We develop a theory of &quot;pricing to firm&quot; (PTF), where markups depend on the technology and competitive environment of the buyer. The predictions of the model are confirmed by the data: import prices are higher for firms with greater market power, and for more essential intermediate inputs (with a high share in material costs). We take account of the endogeneity of the buyer&#39;s market power with respect to higher import prices. We show that even if unobserved cost heterogeneity within product categories is substantial, it is uncorrelated with our variables of interest. The magnitude of PTF is big: the standard deviation of price predicted by PTF is 21.5 percent.

        Title: Volatility and Development
        Abstract: >
            Why is GDP growth so much more volatile in poor countries than in rich ones? We identify three possible reasons: (i) poor countries specialize in fewer and more volatile sectors, (ii) poor countries experience more frequent and more severe aggregate domestic shocks, and (iii) poor countries&#39; macroeconomic fluctuations are more highly correlated with the shocks affecting the sectors they specialize in. We show how to decompose volatility into these three sources, quantify their contribution to aggregate volatility, and study how they relate to the stage of development. We find that, as countries develop, their productive structure moves from more volatile to less volatile sectors and the volatility of country-specific macroeconomic shocks declines. There is also evidence that the level of specialization follows a U-shaped curve with respect to development; the higher specialization at later stages, however, occurs in low-volatility sectors. We argue that many theories linking volatility and development are not consistent with these findings, and suggest new directions for future theoretical work.

        Title: "Employment Response to Real Exchange Rate Movements: Evidence from Hungarian Exporting Firms"
        Abstract: >
            In this paper I estimate the labor demand response of Hungarian exporting firms to real exchange rate
            movements. The use of firm level export/import data enables me to separate two channels through
            which the exchange rate affects labor demand. First, a real depreciation raises the forint-equivalent
            price of foreign competitors, thereby boosting demand for the firm’s export and, hence, the firm’s
            demand for labor. Second, by raising the cost of imported inputs, a depreciation has an adverse effect
            on employment through the cost channel. A higher marginal cost induces a decrease in production
            and thus shrinks labor demand. Since firms with higher export share tend to import more, this latter
            negative effect might offset the former positive one. The cost effect may be dampened if labor and
            imported inputs are substitutes. I show that the relative importance of the demand and cost effects is industry specific. The short-run exchange rate/employment elasticity stemming from the demand effect is around 0.04. This channel is most pronounced in the case of the Food and tobacco industry. Machinery, on the other hand, exhibits a cost effect of roughly −0.04. Surprisingly, I find no evidence that export share affects exchange rate exposure.

        Abstract: >
            This policy report asks how the Great Recession impacted European firms. There is a large amount of heterogeneity across countries and firms in the way they were affected by or responded to the crisis. We use the unique firm-level dataset compiled from the EFIGE Survey to uncover this heterogeneity. We find that exporters contracted more than non-exporters, while importers, those that outsource some of their production or have an affiliate suffered less of a decline. This raises an important policy trade-off. On the one hand, while export oriented strategies may improve competitiveness, they also bring about a greater exposure to foreign crisis. The flip side of the same trade-off is that outsourcing to other countries has distinct stabilisation benefits. Dominant firms centrally placed in the technology, trade and ownership network, fared better. Further, we find that firms relying on external finance and experiencing financial constraints to growth experienced a greater sales decline.

        Title: Volatility, diversification and development in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries
        Abstract: >
            This paper studies the evolution of volatility and its sources in the six Gulf Cooperation
            Council (GCC) countries from 1970 to the present. We break down volatility into three
            main components. The first component relates to the volatility caused by sector-specific
            shocks (e.g. shocks to the oil sector). The second component relates to aggregate
            country-specific shocks that affect all sectors in the economy (e.g. shocks due to policy
            or political instability). The third component relates to the covariance between countryspecific
            and sector-specific shocks (e.g. the degree of pro- or counter-cyclicality of
            macroeconomic policy vis-à-vis sectoral shocks). We find that volatility has
            significantly declined in the past four decades, in part due to a higher degree of sectoral
            diversification in most GCC economies. There is, however, considerable scope for
            progress, which could stem, for example, from more countercyclical fiscal and
            monetary policies. Moreover, the global financial crisis has revealed financial-sector
            vulnerabilities in some GCC countries that need to be addressed in order to limit future
            economic disruptions.

        Date: 2013-05-02
        abstract: >
            We build a continuous-space theory of trade in which people in a region
            agglomerate to exploit trading opportunities with another region. The
            regions are separated by a river, which can be crossed anywhere, but more
            cheaply at bridges. In the model, most trade takes place via bridges,
            leading to a key prediction that population density declines with distance
            to the bridge. We derive additional predictions about the spatial
            distribution of population and test them on high-resolution population
            density data around six major American rivers. The data are mostly
            consistent with our model. More generally, our results suggest that
            economies of density arising from transport infrastructure can help explain
            why and where people agglomerate.

        title: Everything all the time? Entry and Exit in U.S. Import Varieties
        Date: 2013-04-01
        abstract: >
            We propose a new theory of the extensive margin of trade based on a standard random-utility, discrete choice model for import demand. Crucially, there are only a finite number of independent purchase decisions each period. Whereas traditional demand systems predict market shares, our model yields instead the probability that a purchase for a given good is supplied by any given country. The model has a rich set of predictions regarding the extensive margin across goods, countries, and time. The underlying probabilistic struc- ture naturally reconciles two commanding observations in the data: there is a large fraction of varieties that are not traded yet the entry and exit rates of commodities are very high. We purse an exhaustive evaluation of the model’s quantitative performance with data on U.S. imports at the HS10 product level over the period 1990-2001. The model reproduces faithfully the cross-section distribution of varieties traded per product along several dimensions. Regard- ing dynamic facts, the model is spot on its predictions on the net change, gross entry and exit of commodities, both by count and weighted by value; as well as survival probabilities and hazard rates. We briefly explore the model’s implications for price changes, using NAFTA as a case study, and welfare gains from new varieties.

        Title: Lumpy Trade and the Welfare Effects of Administrative Barriers
        Abstract: >
            Using detailed U.S. and Spanish export data, we document that administrative
            trade costs of per shipment nature (documentation, customs clearance and 
            inspection) lead to less frequent and larger-sized shipments, i.e. more 
            lumpiness, in international trade. We build a model to analyze these effects 
            and their welfare consequences. Exporters decide not only how much to sell 
            at a given price, but also how to break up total trade into individual 
            shipments. Consumers value frequent shipments, because they enable them to 
            consume close to their preferred dates. Having fewer shipments hence entails 
            a welfare cost. Calibrating the model to observed shipping frequencies and 
            per-shipment costs, we show that countries would gain 2-3 percent of 
            their GDP by eliminating such barriers. This suggests that trade volumes 
            alone are insufficient to understand the gains from trade.

        abstract: >
            We conduct sector-level development accounting in a macro model where land and location play a role. Producers in agriculture, manufacturing and services choose their location to trade off transport costs to the city center and rents. We solve for the spatial equilibrium and show how space affects the aggregate production function and measured productivity. Studies not accounting for sector location will deem services in large, expensive cities unproductive. This biases development accounting because rich countries have large service-cities. Our preliminary calibrations show that, correcting for sector location, service productivity varies as much across countries as manufacturing productivity does. This is in contrast with previous studies that found smaller variation in service productivity.

        Title: Imported Inputs and Productivity
        Abstract: >
            We estimate a model of importers in Hungarian micro data and conduct counterfactual policy analysis to investigate the effect of imports on productivity. We find that importing all foreign varieties would increase firm productivity by 12 percent, almost two-fifths of which is due to imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic goods. The effectiveness of import use is higher for foreign firms and increases when a firm becomes foreign-owned. Our estimates imply that during 1993-2002 one-third of the productivity growth in Hungary was due to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity gain from a tariff cut is largest when the economy has many importers and many foreign firms, implying policy complementarities between tariff cuts, dismantling non-tariff barriers, and FDI liberalization.

            Machines and machinists: Capital-skill complementarity from an international trade perspective
        Abstract: We estimate the effect of imported machines on the wages of machine operators utilizing Hungarian linked employer-employee data. We infer exposure to imported machines from detailed trade statistics of the firm and the occupation description of the worker. We find that workers exposed to imported machines earn about 8 percent higher wages than other machine operators at the same firm. When we proxy for unobserved worker characteristics, we find a significant 3 percent wage premium, suggesting that the relationship is causal. The return to schooling is also higher on imported machines. We build a simple matching model consistent with these findings. Our findings suggest that machine imports can be an important channel through which skill-biased technical change reaches less developed and emerging economies.

            Existing wisdom links increased openness to trade to greater macroeconomic volatility, as trade induces a country to specialize, increasing its exposure to sector-speciÖc
            shocks. Evidence suggests, however, that country-wide shocks are at least as important
            as sectoral shocks in shaping volatility patterns. We argue that if country-wide shocks
            are dominant, the impact of trade on volatility can be negative, because trade becomes
            a source of diversiÖcation. For example, trade allows domestic goods producers to respond to shocks to the domestic supply chain by shifting sourcing abroad. Similarly,
            when a country has multiple trading partners, a domestic recession or a recession in
            any one of the trading partners translates into a smaller demand shock for its producers
            than when trade is more limited. Using a calibrated version of the Eaton-Kortum and
            Alvarez-Lucas model, we quantitatively assess the impact of lower trade barriers on
            volatility since the 1970s in a broad group of countries.

        Title: A Spatial Explanation for the Balassa-Samuelson Effect
        Abstract: >
            We propose a simple spatial model to explain why the price level is higher in rich countries. There are two sectors: manufacturing, which is freely tradable, and non-tradable services, which have to locate near customers in big cities. As countries develop, total factor productivity increases simultaneously in both sectors. However, because services compete with the population for scarce land, labor productivity will grow slower in services than in manufacturing. Services become more expensive, and the aggregate price level becomes higher. The model hence provides a theoretical foundation for the Balassa--Samuelson assumption that productivity growth is slower in the non-tradable sector than in the tradable sector. Empirical results confirm two key implications of the theory. First, we compare countries where land is scarce (densely populated, highly urban countries) to rural countries. The Balassa--Samuelson effect is stronger among urban countries. Second, we compare sectors that locate at different distance to consumers. The Balassa--Samuelson effect is stronger within sectors that locate closer to consumers.
